# MyAOnionpp

A clean, modular solution following the **Onion Architecture** pattern, built with ASP.NET Core. This structure separates concerns across layers to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## 🧅 Architecture Overview

```
/MyApp
├── MyApp.Domain // Core business logic and entities (pure domain layer)
├── MyApp.Application // Application services, interfaces, DTOs, business rules
├── MyApp.Infrastructure // Implementations for data access, external services, etc.
└── MyApp.Web // Web API layer (entry point)
```


### 🔁 Layer Responsibilities

| Layer              | Responsibility                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain**         | Contains business entities, enums, value objects, and domain interfaces         |
| **Application**    | Coordinates business logic, use cases, and defines service contracts            |
| **Infrastructure** | Implements application and domain interfaces (e.g., repositories, file storage) |
| **Web**            | ASP.NET Core API that handles HTTP requests and delegates to application layer  |
